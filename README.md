# SA55-pemivibart mAb immunobridging comparison

This repository includes data and code to reproduce the immunobridging analysis
in "SA55 broadly neutralizes SARS-CoV-2 and robustly prevents viral escape by JN.1 sublineages."

The dose-response model and associated functions used in this analysis were published by Stadler et al. and are available in GitHub:

This analysis can be performed by generating the dose-response model from the raw data included in the GitHub repository cited above, or by utilizing the model data files included in the current repository. In either case, run the initial driver.R and setup.R files in cited repository above to load the necessary packages and functions.
